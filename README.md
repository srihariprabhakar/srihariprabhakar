I’m Srihari, a certified Cloud Solution Architect and currently a Technical Account Manager at DigitalOcean. I specialize in helping teams build, scale, and troubleshoot cloud-native applications, with a focus on reliability, performance, and automation.

I've worked across Azure, DigitalOcean, and AWS ecosystems designing infrastructure, writing infrastructure as code, automating repetitive tasks, and getting to the root of those “it only breaks in prod” issues while constantly contributing; whether it’s scaling workloads, refining DevOps pipelines, or making cloud bills less painful!

## What I Work With

Cloud Platforms: Azure, AWS, DigitalOcean

Infrastructure as Code: Terraform, Bicep, CloudFormation

Containers & Orchestration: Docker, Kubernetes, Helm, Ingress Controllers

DevOps & Automation: GitHub Actions, Azure DevOps, CI/CD pipelines, Bash, Python

Observability & Monitoring: Prometheus, Grafana, Cloud-native logging and metrics

Networking & Security: VPCs, Firewalls, IAM/RBAC, Private Networking, TLS

## What You’ll Find Here:

Mostly small projects, diagnostic tools, automation scripts, and cloud-native demos — built to keep learning, contribute to the community, and sometimes just to scratch a technical itch.
