## 👋 Hi, I’m Srihari — part cloud engineer, part network whisperer, and full-time problem solver.

With 4+ years of wrangling cloud infrastructure, automating away repetitive tasks, and untangling networking puzzles, I’ve learned one thing: the cloud is awesome — but only if it works. That’s where I come in.
I’ve deployed apps with GitHub Actions (yes, on a Friday — I live dangerously), managed production workloads in AKS without breaking a sweat (mostly), and scripted my way out of more incidents than I care to admit.

Now, I’m channeling that experience toward something bigger: helping customers succeed. As a Technical Account Manager, I’m here to:

- Translate tech jargon into human (and vice versa)
- Keep systems stable, scalable, and sane
- Be the calm in the middle of your cloud storm ☁️⚡
- And make sure you never hear the phrase “it works on my machine” again!

🔧 Tech Stack (a.k.a. my toolbox for solving customer chaos)
☁️ Cloud Platforms:
Skilled in architecting, deploying, and supporting solutions on Azure, AWS, and Oracle Cloud — with hands-on experience in designing secure, high-availability environments tailored to business needs.

📦 Infrastructure as Code:
Building scalable and reproducible environments using Terraform and Bicep, ensuring that cloud deployments are not just fast, but also documented, version-controlled, and rollback-friendly (aka less stressful for everyone).

🐳 Containers & Orchestration:
Deploying and managing Docker-based apps in Kubernetes (AKS) with Helm for templated goodness. Bonus: I enjoy troubleshooting those mysterious “it works locally” issues.

🚀 CI/CD Pipelines:
Designing and optimizing pipelines with GitHub Actions and Azure DevOps to help teams ship faster, safer, and more often (without breaking production at 2 AM).

📊 Monitoring & Observability:
Proactive problem detection and incident response with Prometheus, Grafana, and Azure Log Analytics — because “nobody told me it was down” shouldn’t be how we find out.

💻 Scripting & Automation:
Automating repetitive tasks and building tools using Bash, PowerShell, and Python — saving hours and maybe a few gray hairs in the process.
